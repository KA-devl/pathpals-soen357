## Introduction 📖

The purpose of this project is to develop a system that improves the process of a delivery service, from
the request of a delivery to post-service feedback. It aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and
customer satisfaction in the delivery service sector.

## Problem definition & solutions 📝

The problem is the lack of an efficient, transparent, and user-friendly software system for a
delivery service. This system should cover the entire delivery process, from the moment a
delivery is requested, to delivery and post-service feedback. Currently, users may face challenges
when requesting deliveries, receiving quotations, communicating about the service, tracking their
orders, making payments, and leaving reviews.
The problem emerged due to the increased demand for delivery services as well as the lack of
innovation in the field. Without a fast, user-friendly and reliable platform, delivery providers
may struggle to meet customer expectations.
The solution is to design and implement a platform that covers all existing aspects of the delivery
process. An emphasis would be put on the speed of a delivery as well as the precision of the
service. It would fix the current issues that are encountered by customers.
The proposed solution would offer several advantages over existing systems:

● User-Friendly Interface: The platform would be designed with simplicity and ease of use
in mind, making it accessible to a wide range of users and only showing them what they
want and need to see.

● Transparency: Users would be able to track their deliveries in real time, improving
transparency and trust in the service

● Efficiency: By automating aspects of the delivery process such as quotation generation
and payment processing, the software system would make the service more efficient

● Customer Satisfaction: By allowing users to leave reviews and feedback, the system
would help to improve the service over time, increasing customer satisfaction

To make the proposed system stand out from competitors, the following features could be
considered:
● Personalized delivery: Provide customers with a personalized delivery experience, where
they can choose where and at what time a package should be delivered.

● Customer service: The system could include a built-in messaging system to allow users to
communicate with the delivery provider directly from the platform should they need
more information.

● Reduce pre-delivery time: Offer the possibility of flexible dropoff for customers so they
do not need to physically go to a post facility. An employee would pick the package and
take care of related operations.

● Customer journey analytics: The provider will collect data in order to improve the
service, leveraging artificial intelligence to predict customer behavior. For example, to
improve delivery times.
